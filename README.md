Here is the repository that holds an app [Macondo in a trouble (aka 4Y11M2D)](https://hydrogo.github.io/4Y11M2D/).

This project has been done for the "Hack-Data" challenge on the [#OpenDataHack2018](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/79/) organized by [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/).

The main idea of the presented project is to estimate a runoff response to an extreme rainfall scenario mentioned in  Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude): "The rains last for four years, eleven months, and two days."

Project presentation and a short description are also available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT3ad_RYrzlsRuMgwlX3Bd1kBU2DtOR-HSPrS-oyW-odTRzxdyU3Ml5MdGAlX7EfxDJN_aw4XzvuHlJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
